                <h3>What is ReInforcement Learning?</h3>
                <p>An AI agent that learns by interacting with the environment, and it receives rewards as feedback for performing actions </p>

            <p>
                Lets take an example of a kid.At first when he sees he touches the fire,thats a -1 point reward.
                When he sees it next time he knows that it hurt and doesn't perform the same action,rewarding himself a +1 point.
                The same happens with AI.It interacts with the environment through trail and error and it learns from its mistakes based on
                the rewards.

                Reinforcement Learning is computational approach of learning from actions.
            </p>
            <div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog/rl/rlprocess.png" alt="" /></div>
            <p>Lets say we have a game,we took the first Frame (State-S0) and the agent took an action(a0).The environment gives a positive reward if alive and
            negative reward if dead.Then the environment goes to State-s1 if not dead.
<br>
            The whole motive of the agent is to maximize the reward.<br>
            Reinforcement Learning process is called <b>Markov Decision Process</b> which implies that agent needs to decide what action needs to be taken
            for the current state and not history of all states and actions it has taken before.            </p>
